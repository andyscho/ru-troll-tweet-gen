# Russian Troll Tweet Generator
Generating tweets based off of [FiveThirtyEight's Collected Data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets)

This was a simple one-off example to demonstrate proof-of-concept to a friend. Uses a pretrained character-level model from textgenrnn.

May or may not expand on this/do more with it later.

The raw FiveThirtyEight csv files were placed in a subdirectory called *tweets*.
